# Discord Judge Bot

This is a simple Discord bot that judges gaming-related stuff with random verdicts and funny sentences. Use it in your server for laughs!

## What It Does
- Responds to `!judge <subject>` (e.g., `!judge Camping`).
- Outputs a random verdict like "BANNED" or "GG WP" in a nice embed.
- Adds a humorous action like "Sent to low-priority queue."

## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/gfgago/judge-bot.git`
2. Install deps: `npm install`
3. Create `.env` with `TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token`
4. Run: `node index.js`

## Usage
